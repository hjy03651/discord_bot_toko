# Docker Update Instructions

The bot is still using the old code because Docker needs to rebuild the image with the latest changes.

## Steps to update:

1. **Stop the current container:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. **Pull latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Rebuild and start with latest code:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

## Alternative method:

If you want to force rebuild:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

The issue should be resolved after rebuilding with the latest code that fixes the variable name conflicts.
